This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You will need to set up authentication via Auth0. You can follow [this guide](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login) to set up an application with the correct redirect and logout urls, and create a `.env.local` file with application secrets.

You will need to add an `AUTH0_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN` variable to the `.env.local` with an [Auth0 access token](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens/get-management-api-access-tokens-for-production) issued to an api with `read:users;read:users_app_metadata;read:user_idp_tokens` scopes

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
